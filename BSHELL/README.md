#A shell written in C based on the POSIX API

This is a project i did based on [brenn10](https://github.com/brenns10/lsh/tree/407938170e8b40d231781576e05282a41634848c)'s [great tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

The code is implemented in a slightly different way than brenn's code. I did this to practise more in C programming language, and to
enhance my understanding to process creation and Fork(), exit() system calles provided by the POSIX API
